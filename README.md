Stupid benchmark
----------------
Kotlin: Exposed DSL vs JDBC using PostgreSQL driver

# Why is it called "stupid"?
This is not an objective bullsh... benchmark that gives an extremely rough estimate of 
performance. I created it mainly out of the need for this test because I 
couldn't find it on the internet. The benchmark results presented below were 
obtained on the same machine where the DBMS was running. Please, treat them 
with a grain of salt, or rather read the source code and run it yourself: the 
queries might not have been written optimally enough.
